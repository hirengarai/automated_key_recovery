        goal (str): Only ``"KEYRECOVERY_DIFF"``.
        R_d (int): Rounds covered by the distinguisher (not attacked).

        r_f (int): Key-recovery rounds appended, on the ciphertext side.
            ``r_b + r_f >= 1``.

            ``key_recovery_modules.trail.build_manual_trail``, to pin a published
            differential. Mutually exclusive with `distinguisher`.
        distinguisher: An ``R_d``-round permutation to SEARCH a trail on.
            Mutually exclusive with `trail`. Exactly one of the two is required.
        objective_target (str): What AutoGuess optimises per S-box:
            - 'OPTIMAL': minimise the guess basis. The bound is filled in from the
              cipher's key size, because AutoGuess' own default starts the descent
              below the basis size of a single S-box.
            - 'OPTIMAL AT MOST X': minimise, starting the descent at X.
            - 'AT MOST X': any basis of size at most X, without minimising.
            - 'EXISTENCE': any basis at all.
        show_mode (int): Result-printing detail level, 0 to 3.
        config_model (dict, optional): Modelling options.
            - 'independent_round_keys' (bool, default True): False keeps the key
              schedule, letting one subkey be bridged from another so that later
              S-boxes can come out free.
            - 'model_type' (str, default 'sat'): AutoGuess backend; also 'milp',
              'smt', 'cp', 'mark', 'elim', 'propagate'.
            - 'maxsteps' (int): AutoGuess determination-step budget. Raise it if a
              solve reports that no guess basis was found.
            - 'sbox_form' (str): how S-boxes enter the relation system, e.g.
              'implication'.
            - 'cipher_name' (str): report label. Defaults to the cipher's own name
              plus the round split.
            - 'distinguisher_goal' (str) / 'distinguisher_config_model' (dict):
              the trail search, used only when `distinguisher` is given.

            'cadical153'), 'timelimit', 'threads', 'preprocess'.
